# advent-of-code-2015

This new REPO will contain all my solutions for the Advent of Code Challenge of 2015. 

All the solutions will be developed in C as I'm in need to refresh my knowledge of the language.

As stated in the "About" section of the Advent Of Code website, I'm not going to post any of the puzzle's descriptions nor any of the inputs.

Here is th link to the official website if you want to try it yourself:
